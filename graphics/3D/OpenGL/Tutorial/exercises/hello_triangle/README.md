## Exercises ##
1. Try to draw 2 triangles next to each other using glDrawArrays by adding more vertices to your data.
2. Create the same 2 triangles using two different VAOs and VBOs for their data.
3. Create two shader programs where the second program uses a different fragment shader that outputs the color yellow; draw both triangles again where one outputs the color yellow.
